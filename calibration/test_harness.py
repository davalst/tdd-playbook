"""Planted-input calibration OF the calibration harness (yes — turtles, but checked ones).

The harness's oracle is deterministic string-matching over the agent's output, so it can be
proven with a STUB `claude` binary and zero model spend: a stub that outputs a WRONG verdict
must FAIL the scenario (the harness can fail), a stub that outputs the right verdict must
PASS (the harness can succeed), and --dry-run must validate the shipped scenarios.
